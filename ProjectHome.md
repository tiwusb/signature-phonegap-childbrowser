I'm quite oppressed by the current situation that there's no existing complete solution for signature on mobile platforms.( some can be obtained by purchase but personally they're not what I want. So why don't I create one as open-source ?)

In my point of view , a classic sequence of signature could be as following:

Capturing the result of user input, afterwards ,  transforming and conserving the results as VARIOUS FILE TYPES which can be suitable for different scenarios and different mobile system for further operation.

Additionally, within the release of phonegap, I'm wondering that it's not a bad idea to learn some tricks which allow developers to do some light-weight mobile developments and prototyping for the heavy-weight champions.What's more, phonegap makes it possible that to do the cross-platform things is no longer as the most painful thing in this universe.


This is an experimental project allows user to input hand-writing via either finger or stylus and do the back round process for potential further implementations, for instance, synchronizing , encrypting, storing with [Sqlite](http://www.sqlite.org).

Foremost utilization of Javascript, HTML5, Phonegap framework,Jquery Mobile. Different native code with corresponding mobile system. Java for Android, Objective-C for Iphone and C# for Windows Phone.

Focusing on Android at first,but will be implemented on Windows Phone and Iphone later on.
